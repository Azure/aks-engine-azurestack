# AKS Engine - Units of Kubernetes on Azure Stack Hub

## Overview

AKS Engine is an ARM template-driven way to provision a self-managed Kubernetes cluster on Azure Stack Hub. By leveraging [ARM (Azure Resource Manager)][ARM], AKS Engine helps you create, destroy and maintain clusters provisioned with basic IaaS resources in Azure Stack Hub.

## Getting started
