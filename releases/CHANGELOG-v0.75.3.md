# [v0.75.3] - 2023-02-03

# Attention!
AKS Engine release v0.75.3, and all future AKS Engine releases on Azure Stack Hub, will be from the new [Azure/aks-engine-azurestack repository](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine-azurestack). As such, all `aks-engine` commands should be replaced with `aks-engine-azurestack`. Please create an [issue in the new repository](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine-azurestack/issues/new) if you find any.¬†

AKS Engine release v0.75.3 on Azure Stack Hub includes a new [Ubuntu 20.04-LTS VHD distro](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine-azurestack/blob/v0.75.3/vhd/release-notes/aks-engine-ubuntu-2004/aks-engine-azurestack-ubuntu-2004_2023.032.2.txt) to use in either your control plane and/or worker node pools. Starting from this release, Ubuntu 18.04 will no longer be supported. Please refer to the section [*Upgrading Kubernetes clusters created with the Ubuntu 18.04 Distro*](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine-azurestack/blob/0d6163211891aba81b8f84e1fd4c021ed6a3d592/docs/topics/azure-stack.md#upgrading-kubernetes-clusters-created-with-the-ubuntu-1804-distro) for more details.¬†


Starting from Kubernetes v1.24, only the `containerd` runtime is supported. Please refer to the section [*Upgrading Kubernetes clusters created with docker runtime*](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine-azurestack/blob/0d6163211891aba81b8f84e1fd4c021ed6a3d592/docs/topics/azure-stack.md#upgrading-kubernetes-clusters-created-with-docker-container-runtime) for more details. For AKS Engine release v0.75.3, clusters with Windows nodes on Kubernetes v1.23 can use [the Windows base image with Docker runtime](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine-azurestack/blob/v0.75.3/vhd/release-notes/aks-windows/2019-datacenter-core-azurestack-smalldisk-17763.3887.20230332.txt). Clusters with Windows nodes on Kubernetes v1.24 can use [the Windows base image with Containerd runtime](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine-azurestack/blob/v0.75.3/vhd/release-notes/aks-windows-2019-containerd/2019-datacenter-core-azurestack-ctrd-17763.3887.20230332.txt).
