# Attention!

Notable changes in this release:

- The control-plane nodes' taint has been changed from node-role.kubernetes.io/master to node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane, requiring users to update tolerations in their applications to schedule pods on these nodes. Example:

```
tolerations:
- key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: NoSchedule

```
- Use the new AzureDisk CSI Driver v1.29.1 for k8s v1.28+. Use AzureDisk CSI Driver v1.26.5 for k8s v1.26.
  - See [Azure Disk CSI Driver: Version Mapping](../docs/topics/azure-stack.md#azure-disk-csi-driver-version-mapping) for more details.
